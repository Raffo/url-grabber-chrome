# URL Grabber

This is the source code for the URL grabber extension for Chromium browsers. It allows you to copy the URL of the current focused tab by pressing CMD+SHIFT+U (Mac) or CTRL+SHIFT+U (Windows/Linux). It doesn't do anything else.

Google charges 5$ to publish things and I'm not paying that. If you want this code take it and use it as unpacked extension.
